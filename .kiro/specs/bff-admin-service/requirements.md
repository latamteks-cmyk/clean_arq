# ðŸ“‹ Requirements Document â€“ BFF Admin Service

## Introduction

This document establishes the auditable requirements for the **BFF Admin Service** (Backend for Frontend - Admin), defining the minimum technical, business, and integration criteria to be validated. The BFF Admin Service acts as an intermediary layer between the admin web interface and backend services, providing optimized data aggregation, caching, and admin-specific business logic for the SmartEdify platform.
