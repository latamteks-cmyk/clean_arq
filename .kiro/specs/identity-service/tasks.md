# Implementation Plan - Identity Service

## Overview
This implementation plan converts the Identity Service design into actionable coding tasks that build incrementally toward a production-ready backend service. Each task focuses on specific functionality with clear integration points and validation criteria, emphasizing secure authentication, JWT/DPoP token management, and OAuth 2.0/OIDC compliance.

## Project Structure
The Identity Service follows the standardized backend service structure defined in [Project Standards](../project-standards.md):

```

## Implementation Standards
All tasks must follow the established [Project Standards](../project-standards.md) including:
- **Security First**: Argon2id password hashing, ES256/EdDSA JWT signing, DPoP token binding
- **OAuth 2.0/OIDC Compliance**: Full OIDC implementation with proper flows and security
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: WebAuthn, TOTP, and SMS/email OTP support
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms token validation, efficient cryptographic operations
