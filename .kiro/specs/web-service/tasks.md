### 🎯 Key Implementation Priorities:

1. **Security First**: JWT/DPoP authentication and multi-tenant isolation
2. **Modern UX**: Responsive design with offline capabilities and PWA features
3. **Service Integration**: Comprehensive testing interfaces for all backend services
4. **Performance**: Sub-2.5s load times with intelligent caching and optimization
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with internationalization support
6. **Production Ready**: Blue-green deployment with comprehensive monitoring

The implementation follows modern React patterns, TypeScript best practices, and enterprise security standards while maintaining seamless integration with the Gateway Service and backend services.
