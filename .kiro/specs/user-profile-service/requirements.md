# ðŸ“‹ Requirements Document â€“ User Profiles Service

## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the auditable requirements for `user-profiles-service` (port 3002), defining the minimum technical, business, and integration criteria to be validated. The service serves as the **canonical source of truth** for user profiles, memberships, local roles, and entitlements within the SmartEdify platform, managing relationships between people and condominium units while ensuring proper role-based access control and compliance with data protection regulations.

## 3. User Registration and Synchronization Flow

### High-Level Integration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UPS as User Profiles Service
    participant K as Kafka
    participant IS as Identity Service
    participant TS as Tenancy Service
    participant CS as Compliance Service

    U->>UPS: POST /profiles/register
    UPS->>CS: Validate legal requirements
    CS-->>UPS: APPROVED
    UPS->>TS: Validate unit/condominium (if provided)
    TS-->>UPS: Unit validated
    UPS->>UPS: Create canonical user profile
    UPS->>K: Emit ProfileCreated event
    K->>IS: Consume ProfileCreated event
    IS->>IS: Create technical identity (auth only)
    IS->>K: Emit TechnicalIdentityCreated event
    K->>UPS: Identity creation confirmation
    UPS->>U: Registration complete
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **User Registration Initiation**
   - User submits registration through user-profiles-service (canonical source)
   - User-profiles-service validates all business data and requirements
   - Compliance-service validates legal requirements and data processing permissions

2. **Canonical Profile Creation**
   - User-profiles-service creates comprehensive user profile as source of truth
   - All business attributes, preferences, and profile data stored here
   - User-profiles-service emits `ProfileCreated` event to Kafka

3. **Technical Identity Creation**
   - Identity-service consumes `ProfileCreated` event
   - Identity-service creates minimal technical identity (authentication only)
   - Email/phone copied for authentication purposes only (not canonical source)

4. **Change Propagation**
   - All profile changes originate from user-profiles-service
   - Events emitted: ProfileUpdated, RoleChanged, PreferencesUpdated, etc.
   - Identity-service and other services consume events for synchronization
   - No direct database access between services

## 4. Cross-Service Integration Validation

**User Story:**  
As a system architect, I want to validate consistency across services to identify missing or incorrect dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN validating consistency THEN the system SHALL ensure identity-service user IDs are created from ProfileCreated events
2. WHEN reviewing APIs THEN the system SHALL verify unit_id references valid tenancy-service units with proper kind validation
3. WHEN analyzing events THEN the system SHALL confirm ProfileCreated events are properly emitted to identity-service
4. WHEN validating security THEN the system SHALL enforce JWT with ES256/EdDSA, kid header, and DPoP for write operations
5. WHEN reviewing data models THEN the system SHALL ensure RLS is active on all tables with proper tenant_id enforcement
6. WHEN validating data ownership THEN the system SHALL confirm it is the exclusive source for all profile data and never delegates to identity-service
7. WHEN reviewing integration patterns THEN the system SHALL confirm identity-service consumes events from user-profiles-service, not vice versa

---

## 5. Reporting & Traceability

- **Traceability:**  
  All requirements must be uniquely referenced (UP-XXX) for traceability in implementation, testing, and audit reports. Each requirement shall be mapped to specific API endpoints, database schemas, and event types.

- **Reporting:**  
  The system SHALL generate a requirements coverage matrix and report all unmet or partially met requirements. Key performance indicators shall include:
  - Profile management operation success rates
  - Permission evaluation latency percentiles
  - Bulk operation completion metrics
  - DSAR request processing times
  - Cross-service integration health

---

## 6. Approval & Change Control

- **Versioning:**  
  Update this document as requirements change, recording revisions and rationales. All changes must reference architectural decisions and compliance impacts, particularly for membership relationship rules and data protection requirements.

- **Approval:**  
  All requirements must be reviewed and approved by architecture and product leads before moving to implementation. Specific approvals required from:
  - Chief Technology Officer
  - Data Protection Officer
  - Product Manager - Community Management
  - Security Architect
