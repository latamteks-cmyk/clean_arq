# ðŸ“‹ Requirements Document â€“ Gateway Service

## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the auditable requirements for the **Gateway Service** (port 8080), defining the minimum technical, business, and integration criteria to be validated. The gateway serves as the **single entry point** for all client traffic (web, mobile, third-party) and provides cross-cutting security, routing, observability, and anti-abuse capabilities for the SmartEdify platform.
