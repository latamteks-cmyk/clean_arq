# ðŸ“‹ Requirements Document â€“ BFF User Service

## Introduction

This document establishes the auditable requirements for the **BFF User Service** (Backend for Frontend - User), defining the minimum technical, business, and integration criteria to be validated. The BFF User Service acts as an intermediary layer between the user web interface and backend services, providing optimized data aggregation, caching, and user-specific business logic for the SmartEdify platform.
