# Technical Design Document – [Module or Service Name]

## 1. Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  _Briefly describe the goal of this design and what it aims to solve or improve._

- **Scope:**  
  _List the systems, services, or modules affected by this design. Define boundaries and out-of-scope elements if necessary._

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Main Components

- **Component List:**  
  _List and describe the main modules, services, or building blocks involved in this design._

- **Diagram:**  
  _Insert a system, flow, or data architecture diagram (use Mermaid, PlantUML, or image)._  
  ```mermaid

## 3. Design & Analysis Methodology

### 3.1 Specification Analysis

* **Input:**
  *Where are the reference specs (docs, drafts, code)?*

* **Process:**
  *Describe how requirements/specs are parsed, validated, or mapped.*

* **Output:**
  *Describe the expected matrices, lists, or analysis artifacts.*

### 3.2 Implementation Analysis

* **Input:**
  *Codebase location, configuration files, schemas.*

* **Process:**
  *Which tools/methods are used for static or dynamic analysis?*

* **Output:**
  *How is the current implementation status captured?*

### 3.3 Cross-Validation

* *Describe the approach to compare specifications versus implementation, identify gaps, and detect inconsistencies.*

### 3.4 Reporting

* *Describe the formats and types of technical and executive reports to be generated.*

## 4. Evaluation Criteria

### 4.1 Audit Dimensions

| Dimension     | Weight | Evaluation Criteria                   |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Functionality | [X]%   | [Endpoints, business logic, flows]    |
| Architecture  | [X]%   | [Patterns, separation, integrations]  |
| Security      | [X]%   | [AuthN, AuthZ, RLS, encryption]       |
| Quality       | [X]%   | [Tests, documentation, observability] |
| Operation     | [X]%   | [Deployment, config, health checks]   |

*Replace [X]% with your project weights.*

### 4.2 Evaluation Scale

* **100%**: Fully implemented per spec
* **75–99%**: Mostly implemented, minor gaps
* **50–74%**: Partially implemented, major gaps
* **25–49%**: Basic implementation, limited functionality
* **0–24%**: Not implemented

---

## 5. Detailed Analysis by Service/Component

### [Service or Component Name]

* **Expected State:**
  *Summarize the requirements or features from the specification.*

* **Implementation Analysis:**
  *Summarize the actual state—structure, DB, APIs, integrations, observability, etc.*

* **Gaps Identified:**
  *List missing features, integrations, or compliance issues.*

---

## 6. Integration & Consistency Matrix (if applicable)

| Source Service | Target Service | Status | Required Endpoints | Implemented |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| ...            | ...            | ...    | ...                | ...         |

---

## 7. Testing & Validation Strategy

* **Structure Tests:**
  *Check for key files, folders, and configs.*

* **API Tests:**
  *Validate endpoints, authentication, and responses.*

* **Integration Tests:**
  *Check inter-service communication and event streaming.*

* **Security Tests:**
  *Validate RLS, JWT/DPoP, encryption, and access controls.*

---

## 8. Tools & Reporting

* **Analysis Tools:**
  *Linters, validators, scripts, CI/CD tools, dashboards.*

* **Reporting Formats:**
  *Markdown, JSON, HTML, CSV, etc.*

---

## 9. Deliverables

* *List all expected deliverables: executive summary, technical report, action plan, progress dashboards, etc.*

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

* **Automation:**
  *Describe scripts, pipelines, or auto-reporting.*

* **Scalability:**
  *How does the design accommodate future growth?*

* **Maintainability:**
  *How will design and codebase stay aligned?*

* **Risks & Mitigations:**
  *Identify risks and proposed mitigations.*

---

## 11. Timeline

* *Phases, milestones, estimated durations.*

---

## 12. Success Criteria

* *Quality metrics, validated deliverables, stakeholder acceptance, etc.*

---

> *This template should be treated as a living document. Update as the design evolves or requirements change.*
